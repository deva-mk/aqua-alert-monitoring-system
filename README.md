# aqua-alert-monitoring-system
Offline-first hydration and health monitoring system with local data storage, risk prediction, and privacy-first healthcare support.
🌊 AquaAlert — Offline Health Monitoring Dashboard
📌 Overview
AquaAlert is an offline-first health monitoring web application that analyzes hydration levels and basic health indicators using local browser processing. The system provides real-time health scoring, risk alerts, and a privacy-first monitoring experience without requiring internet connectivity.
This project runs entirely inside a web browser and stores data locally.

💧 Hydration Monitoring
1)Tracks daily water intake
2)Calculates hydration health score
3)Detects dehydration risk
4)Provides health recommendations

🧪 Water & Vital Monitoring
1)Water pH level tracking
2)Body temperature monitoring
3)Mineral level assessment
4)Basic health risk prediction

🎨 Interactive User Interface
1)Animated splash screen intro
2)Modern health dashboard layout
3)Real-time analysis display
4)Custom sparkle cursor effect
5)Responsive card-based design

⚡ Offline Functionality
1)Runs without internet
2)No server required
3)Local browser processing
4)Portable health monitoring system

🎯 Project Purpose
1)AquaAlert is designed to support:
2)Personal hydration tracking
3)Offline health monitoring
4)Privacy-focused healthcare systems
5)Rural or low-connectivity environments
6)Educational health monitoring projects

🛠 Technology Stack
1)HTML5 — Application structure
2)CSS3 — Styling and animations
3)JavaScript — Health analysis logic
4)Browser APIs — Local execution
5)No backend or external dependencies required.

⚙️ How It Works
---User enters hydration and health data.
---System analyzes input using built-in logic.
---Hydration score is calculated.
---Health status is displayed.
---Data can be saved locally.
---All processing happens inside the browser.

▶️ How to Run the Project
Step 1 — Download the file
   Save the project file as:aquaalert.html
Step 2 — Open in browser
   Double-click the file or open it in any modern web browser.
✅ No installation required
✅ No internet required

📊 Health Analysis Logic
The system calculates a health score based on:
---Water intake level
---Body temperature
---Basic health conditions
   Example Rules
---Low water intake → reduced hydration score
---High temperature → health warning
  Score ≥ 70 → Healthy
  Score < 70 → Risk alert

🔐 Privacy & Security
-->No internet communication
-->No cloud storage
-->Local data processing only
-->User-controlled health information

🌟 Innovation Highlights
